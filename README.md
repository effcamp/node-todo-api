# node-todo-api

This is a complete todo list api that has users and authentication with jwt and x-auth headers. There is no front-end as of now, therefore all testing was done with postman. The backend is a locally hosted Mongo database. It's hosted on Heroku and uses the mLab mongo plugin as a DB there. This is a very complete api using many different expressJS features and also includes pretty extensive testing using Mocha.
